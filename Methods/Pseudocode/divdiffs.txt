Divided Differences 

read vector X, vector Y 
check if they have the same size. 
function divdiff: 
    length = lenght(X)
    D = zeros(n) 
    D[column i] = Y(transposed) 
	
    for i=2 to n: 
	temporal = D[column i, below the diagonal] 
	temp1 = difference between adjacent vector values for temporal
	temp2 = X(from i to n) - X(from the first value to n-i+1)
	D[column i below the diagonal] = temp1./temp2
    end for
    coef = diag(D)'   
    return coef, D
end function.
