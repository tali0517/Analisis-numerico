Vandermonde 

read vector X, vector Y
check if both vectors are the same size. 
function vandermonde:	# (Must be same size) 
    length = length(X)
    A = squared matrix of zeros
    a = vector size(length)
    for i=0 to length do:
	A[column i] = (X.^(length-i))	# Assign to matrix A, column i the values in X risen to (length-i)
    end for 
    coeficient = A/Y
    return coeficient, A. 
end function.
